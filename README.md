## Machine Learning with Sklearn pipelines 
  

### This is a simple self study notebook on the implementation of sklearn pipelines in a ML project.  Main elements in the notebook:  
- Pipelines for imputation of null values in a categorical feature column and a numerical feature column   
- Usage of a column transformer to combine the pipelines 
- Pipelines for ML models and transformers 
- Grid and Randomized CV with plot of results      
- Pickle for data frame seralization
